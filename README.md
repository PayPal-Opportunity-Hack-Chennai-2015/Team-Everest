Enable children to receive scholarships by creating a platform where the profiles of the beneficiaries can be shared with the benefactors. The platform should present information about the recipients and create a connection between the donors and the benificiaries, and match donors to recipients. 

"82% of students drop out after Plus-2 due to huge cost of higher education. On the other hand, around 177 crores of scholarship funds allocated by different foundations were not dispersed due to lack of awareness or they could not spot a deserving student. We would like to bridge this gap.

We would like to create a platform where students can submit their request for help or any volunteer who knows a student can submit request on behalf of student thereby providing a voice for the student to get his request fulfilled. NGOâ€™s registered on the platform will be notified about the help request. Any NGO who feels the student is deserving and fulfils their selection criteria can sponsor the student there by making a difference.
