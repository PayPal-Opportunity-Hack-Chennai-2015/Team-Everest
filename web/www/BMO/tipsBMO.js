What is duplexing?"," In wireless communication it is often desired to do two tasks simultaneously i.e. transfer of information from base station to the mobile unit and from the mobile unit to the base station. For example consider the traditional landline phones where it is possible to listen and talk simultaneously, this is known as Duplexing. Duplexing can be divided based on time or frequency slots. If it is divided based on frequency it is known as Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) and if it is divided based on time slots it is known as Time Division Duplexing (TDD).",this.likecount,"Like",this.commentcount,"Comment","icon ion-thumbsup","icon ion-chatbox","icon ion-star","like","comment","bookmark"));
